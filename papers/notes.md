# Papers

## Jegadeesh and Titman 1993: Returns to Buying Winners and Selling Losers: Implications for Stock Market Efficiency
- Seminal paper documenting momentum anomaly: buying past winners and selling past losers generates significant abnormal returns
- Tests strategies using 3-12 month formation and holding periods across NYSE/AMEX stocks
- Finds momentum profits persist for several months but reverse in the long run (2-5 years)
- Proposes two behavioral explanations: delayed overreaction to firm-specific information and underreaction to short-term news
- Challenges efficient market hypothesis as returns cannot be explained by systematic risk

## Jegadeesh and Titman 2001: Profitability of Momentum Strategies: An Evaluation of Alternative Explanations
- Revisits the 1993 findings and examines whether momentum profits persist
- Evaluates alternative explanations including risk-based and behavioral theories
- Finds that momentum profits continue in the 1990s
- Analyzes post-holding period returns to distinguish between behavioral models

## Blitz and Hanauer 2020: The Idiosyncratic Momentum Anomaly
- Proposes decomposing total momentum into systematic and idiosyncratic components
- Finds that idiosyncratic momentum (stock-specific returns after removing market/factor exposure) generates stronger and more persistent returns than total momentum
- Shows that systematic momentum (returns attributable to factor exposures) is much weaker and less reliable
- Explains that idiosyncratic momentum is less crowded and experiences less severe crashes
- Provides evidence that momentum profits primarily stem from firm-specific information diffusion rather than broad market trends
- Suggests improved risk-adjusted returns by focusing on idiosyncratic rather than total returns

## Hanauer and Windmuller 2022: Enhanced Momentum
- Proposes an enhanced momentum strategy that combines multiple momentum signals to improve performance
- Integrates traditional price momentum with residual momentum (idiosyncratic returns after factor adjustments)
- Shows that combining different momentum measures produces higher Sharpe ratios and reduced crash risk
- Finds that the enhancement is robust across international markets and different time periods
- Demonstrates that diversification across momentum signals reduces exposure to momentum crashes
- Provides practical implementation guidance for constructing multi-signal momentum portfolios
