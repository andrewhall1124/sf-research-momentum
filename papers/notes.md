# Papers

## Jegadeesh and Titman 1993: Returns to Buying Winners and Selling Losers: Implications for Stock Market Efficiency
- Seminal paper documenting momentum anomaly: buying past winners and selling past losers generates significant abnormal returns
- Tests strategies using 3-12 month formation and holding periods across NYSE/AMEX stocks
- Finds momentum profits persist for several months but reverse in the long run (2-5 years)
- Proposes two behavioral explanations: delayed overreaction to firm-specific information and underreaction to short-term news
- Challenges efficient market hypothesis as returns cannot be explained by systematic risk

## AQR 2009: The Case for Momentum Investing
- Practical guide to implementing momentum strategies in institutional portfolios
- Reviews four potential explanations: slow information diffusion, disposition effect, bandwagon/herding behavior, and risk compensation
- Demonstrates momentum's robustness across time periods, markets, and asset classes
- Addresses implementation challenges including high turnover, transaction costs, and capacity constraints
- Discusses risk management approaches including diversification and combining with value strategies

## Jegadeesh and Titman 2001: Profitability of Momentum Strategies: An Evaluation of Alternative Explanations
- Revisits the 1993 findings and examines whether momentum profits persist
- Evaluates alternative explanations including risk-based and behavioral theories
- Finds that momentum profits continue in the 1990s
- Analyzes post-holding period returns to distinguish between behavioral models

## Asness, Moskowitz, and Pedersen 2013: Value and Momentum Everywhere
- Documents value and momentum effects across asset classes (stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities)
- Shows these strategies are negatively correlated, providing diversification benefits
- Evidence suggests common behavioral and risk-based drivers across markets
- Demonstrates that combined value-momentum strategies have better risk-adjusted returns

## Daniel and Moskowitz 2016: Momentum Crashes
- Documents that momentum strategies suffer severe crashes during market rebounds following market declines
- Proposes a theoretical model based on time-varying risk aversion and behavioral biases
- Shows momentum portfolios have option-like characteristics with negative skewness
- Suggests dynamic risk management approaches to mitigate crash risk

## George and Hwang 2004: The 52-Week High and Momentum Investing
- Introduces nearness to 52-week high as a momentum indicator
- Shows stocks near their 52-week highs earn higher subsequent returns
- This measure captures gradual information diffusion and anchoring bias
- 52-week high strategy performs better than traditional momentum in some contexts

## Moskowitz and Grinblatt 1999: Do Industries Explain Momentum?
- Examines whether momentum profits come from industry-level or individual stock effects
- Finds that much of individual stock momentum is driven by industry momentum
- Industry momentum strategies are more profitable than within-industry strategies
- Suggests investors underreact to information at the industry level

## Da and Gurun 2014: Frog in the Pan: Continuous Information and Momentum
- Distinguishes between discrete jumps and continuous information flow
- Stocks with gradual price changes (continuous information) show stronger momentum
- Investors underreact more to continuous information than to discrete jumps
- Title references the "boiling frog" metaphor about gradual versus sudden changes

## Moskowitz, Ooi, and Pedersen 2012: Time Series Momentum
- Introduces time series momentum: assets' own past returns predict future returns
- Distinct from cross-sectional momentum (relative performance)
- Works across diverse asset classes (commodities, currencies, bonds, equity indices)
- Provides diversification benefits and works in different market environments

## Hühn and Scholz 2018: Momentum Dynamics: Duration and Magnitude-Dependence
- Analyzes how the duration and magnitude of past performance affect momentum
- Finds that both longer duration trends and larger magnitude moves predict stronger momentum
- Explores the dynamics of trend formation and reversal patterns
- Provides insights for optimizing momentum strategy parameters

## AQR 2009: The Case for Momentum Investing
- Practical guide to implementing momentum strategies
- Reviews academic evidence and real-world performance
- Discusses implementation challenges (turnover, transaction costs, capacity)
- Addresses common criticisms and risk management considerations
